# ABUD Shorts Engine - operator command
# ==============================================================================
# Installed as /usr/local/bin/abud-shorts. Everything an administrator needs to
# run the product day to day, without knowing any Docker syntax:
#
#   abud-shorts status          is it healthy, and which version
#   abud-shorts update          fetch, verify, back up, install, verify, or roll back
#   abud-shorts update --check  report only, change nothing
#   abud-shorts backup          make a database and configuration snapshot now
#   abud-shorts diagnostics     write a support bundle
#   abud-shorts start|stop|restart
#   abud-shorts rollback        return to the previous working version
#
# This is a thin wrapper. The real work lives in abud-update.sh and in the
# services the application already provides.
