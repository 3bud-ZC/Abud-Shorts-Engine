/**
 * FAST HEALTH
 * -----------
 * Why this exists.
 *
 * The System Health page used to build its whole first paint from
 * `Promise.all([/system/health, /system/diagnostics, /system/storage])`. Two of
 * those are expensive by construction:
 *
 *   - `/system/diagnostics` calls `publishingRegistry.validateAll()`, which
 *     contacts every configured publishing platform over the network on a 30s
 *     per-provider client timeout, then walks the entire data directory
 *     synchronously, then reads the log file.
 *   - `/system/storage` walks videos, cache, models, backups and logs
 *     recursively with synchronous `readdirSync`/`statSync`, which on a real
 *     installation with a few hundred rendered videos blocks the event loop for
 *     seconds at a time.
 *
 * `Promise.all` finishes with the slowest of those, and the page gated its
 * first render on the whole set, so the customer sat on a spinner for as long
 * as the slowest external provider took - and indefinitely if one of them never
 * answered, because the browser requests carried no client timeout either. That
 * is the "Checking V2 system diagnostics…" the customer reported. It was never
 * a timeout that needed raising; it was a fast path that did not exist.
 *
 * What this module guarantees.
 *
 *   1. Every check is individually bounded. A single unreachable service can
 *      cost at most `FAST_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS`, never the page.
 *   2. Nothing here walks storage, parses logs or contacts a paid provider API.
 *      Provider *configuration* is read from local state; provider *reachability*
 *      belongs to deep diagnostics.
 *   3. An optional provider that was never configured reports `not_configured`
 *      and does not count towards "needs attention". A customer who never wanted
 *      TikTok publishing should not be told their system is unhealthy.
 *   4. The result is cached briefly, so the page's polling and a customer
 *      hammering Refresh cannot turn a cheap endpoint into load.
