/**
 * STOCK QUERY FAMILY ENGINE
 * -------------------------
 * One scene intent should produce several *different ways of showing it*, not
 * one literal restatement of the sentence.
 *
 * Before F2.1 a scene reached the stock providers with whatever `searchTerms`
 * the planner emitted - usually one near-transliteration of the narration, with
 * a fixed joker list ("nature", "globe", "space", "ocean") behind it. When the
 * literal phrase returned nothing the production fell straight through to
 * footage of the ocean, which is why unrelated clips appeared in business ads.
 *
 * A query *family* is an angle on the same intent: the object itself, the action
 * around it, the environment it lives in, the audience using it, and an abstract
 * support shot. Asking each family separately gives the selector genuinely
 * different candidates to score instead of eighty near-identical results from
 * one phrase.
 *
 * Everything here is deterministic and local. The narration may be Arabic; the
 * providers are queried in English, so concepts are mapped through a bilingual
 * lexicon rather than machine-translated at render time.
