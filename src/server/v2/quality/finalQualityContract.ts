/**
 * FINAL QUALITY CONTRACT (V2.5.1)
 * -------------------------------
 * Before this module the last step of a production collapsed every possible
 * complaint - a corrupt container, a silent mix, a scene that used a motion
 * graphic instead of stock footage - into one boolean (`professionalReady`)
 * and one English sentence ("Final video quality checks did not pass."). A
 * customer reached 99% and lost a perfectly playable 1080p render because a
 * *creative* coverage preference was not met.
 *
 * The real incident this module exists to fix (job `cmtt8qpu2000107n9cde01r3p`,
 * Arabic 16:9 15s, VoiceTut, Auto media): audio QA passed, the silence gate
 * passed, zero black frames, zero repeated assets, semantic relevance 100, and
 * a valid 1920x1080 h264+aac 15.48s MP4 existed on disk - yet the job was
 * marked `failed` because `realVisualCoveragePercent` was 64.6 instead of >= 90
 * (one of five shots fell back to a locally generated graphic).
 *
 * The fix is a severity model, not a lowered threshold. Every gate keeps its
 * threshold and keeps reporting truthfully; what changes is the *consequence*:
 *
 *   HARD  - the output is not a usable video (missing/corrupt container, no
 *           video stream, missing narration audio, impossible duration,
 *           render exception). Terminal state: `failed`, no output offered.
 *   SOFT  - the output IS a usable video but did not meet a creative or
 *           editorial preference. Terminal state: `needs_review`, output
 *           preserved, preview + download available, reasons shown verbatim.
 *
 * Every finding carries a `messageKey` rather than an English sentence, so the
 * Arabic interface renders an Arabic reason instead of a translated-at-the-edge
 * English one. `technicalDetail` stays English and stays inside the collapsed
 * technical panel.
