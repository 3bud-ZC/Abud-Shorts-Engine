/**
 * CREDENTIAL PRECEDENCE
 * ---------------------
 * One deterministic rule for "which credential is actually in use", and a way to
 * say so in the UI without ever returning the secret.
 *
 * The engine can learn a credential from two places: the encrypted vault, which
 * is what the customer fills in from the browser, and the installation
 * environment, which is what an operator sets once at install time. Before F3
 * different call sites picked whichever they happened to read first, so a
 * customer could save a key in the browser and still have the engine silently
 * use a stale environment value.
 *
 * The rule, in order:
 *
 *   1. the customer's vault credential
 *   2. the installation environment credential, where that is intentionally
 *      supported for the provider
 *   3. nothing - the provider is Not Configured
 *
 * The vault wins because it is the one the customer can see and change.
