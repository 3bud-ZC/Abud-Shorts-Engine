/**
 * BILINGUAL PRODUCT FOUNDATION - TYPES
 * ------------------------------------
 * ABUD Shorts ships two first-class interface languages. The interface
 * language is a *product* setting and is deliberately independent from the
 * language a video is narrated in: an Arabic-speaking operator producing
 * English content is a supported, ordinary case.
 *
 * Everything customer-facing resolves through one catalogue rather than
 * `language === "ar" ? … : …` scattered through components, so a missing
 * translation is a data problem in one file instead of a rendering bug in
 * twenty.
