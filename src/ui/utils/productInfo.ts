/**
 * PRODUCT IDENTITY, READ FROM THE CANONICAL CONTRACT
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * `/api/v2/system/info` serves `src/version.ts`, which is the one place that
 * says what this build is. The Setup wizard used to print "Version 2.1.0" as a
 * literal, so a customer running 2.2.0 was told they were running 2.1.0 - the
 * kind of claim that quietly makes every support conversation start from a
 * false premise.
 *
 * Nothing in the interface should ever hardcode a version again. When the
 * endpoint has not answered yet, `version` is `null` and the caller renders
 * nothing rather than guessing.
