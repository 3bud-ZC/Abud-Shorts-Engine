/**
 * ABUD DESIGN TOKENS
 * ------------------
 * The single source of colour, radius, spacing and elevation for the whole
 * dashboard. Components read from here (or from the MUI theme built on top of
 * it) and never hardcode a hex value, so the product reads as one system.
 *
 * Visual direction: premium near-black surfaces, a violet primary identity, a
 * restrained cyan accent and a green success state, with glow used sparingly.
 * This is an operational control panel, not a marketing page - contrast and
 * legibility win over spectacle, and glow is never placed behind body text.

/**
 * TYPE SCALE
 * ----------
 * The dashboard used to lean on MUI's defaults, which put body text at 14px and
 * captions at 12px on a near-black background. That is legible on a designer's
 * monitor and genuinely hard to read on an operator's 1366x768 laptop, which is
 * why several screens read as dense walls of grey text.
 *
 * The scale below moves the floor up: nothing customer-facing is smaller than
 * 12.5px, body copy sits at 15px, and weight is used sparingly - 600 for
 * emphasis, 700 for headings, and nothing at 800+ except a card's headline
 * number. Heavy weight everywhere flattens hierarchy instead of creating it.
 *
 * Sizes are `rem` so a browser or OS text-size preference still scales the
 * whole product.
